--QUESTION 1

-- join orders and shippers --

--checkout orders
SELECT * FROM orders

--checkout shippers
SELECT * FROM shippers

--perform inner join for now
SELECT * FROM orders JOIN shippers ON shipvia = shipperid

--best practice
SELECT * FROM orders JOIN shippers ON orders.shipvia = shippers.shipperid

--reformat with aliases
SELECT *
FROM orders AS o
JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid


--QUESTION 2

--just certain columns
SELECT o.orderid, o.orderdate, o.freight, s.companyname
FROM orders AS o
JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid


--QUESTION 3

--full outer join
SELECT o.orderid, o.orderdate, o.freight, s.companyname
FROM orders AS o
FULL OUTER JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid

--left join

FROM orders AS o
LEFT JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid

--right join
SELECT o.orderid, o.orderdate, o.freight, s.companyname
FROM orders AS o
RIGHT JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid

--left table with no matches
SELECT o.orderid, o.orderdate, o.freight, s.companyname
FROM orders AS o
LEFT JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid
WHERE s.shipperid IS NULL


--QUESTION 4

--right table with no matches
SELECT o.orderid, o.orderdate, o.freight, s.companyname
FROM orders AS o
RIGHT JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid
WHERE o.shipvia IS NULL


--check both no matches at same time
SELECT o.orderid, o.orderdate, o.freight, s.companyname
FROM orders AS o
FULL OUTER JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid
WHERE o.shipvia IS NULL OR s.shipperid IS NULL


--QUESTION 5

--How many orders were shipped with each company (>0 first)?
SELECT s.companyname, COUNT(*)
FROM orders AS o
JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid
GROUP BY s.companyname
--can add an orderby

--How many orders were shipped with each company (all)? WRONG
SELECT s.companyname, COUNT(*)
FROM orders AS o
FULL OUTER JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid
GROUP BY s.companyname
--can add an orderby

--How many orders were shipped with each company (all)? CORRECT
SELECT s.companyname, COUNT(o.orderid)
FROM orders AS o
FULL OUTER JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid
GROUP BY s.companyname
--can add an orderby


--QUESTION 6

--What was the total weight shipped by each company?
SELECT s.companyname, SUM(o.freight)
FROM orders AS o
FULL OUTER JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid
GROUP BY s.companyname
--can add an orderby


--QUESTION 7

--What was the average weight shipped by each company?
SELECT s.companyname, AVG(o.freight)
FROM orders AS o
FULL OUTER JOIN shippers AS s
ON o.shipvia = s.shipperid

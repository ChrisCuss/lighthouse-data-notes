Aroma: overwhelmingly alcohol forward. Really have to fight through the alcohol to find that cooked agave aroma. There are some hints of minerality and fresh cut grass. 

Flavor: very one dimensional. There’s a strong bitterness that hits my mid palate. Some cooked agave comes through but overall this doesn’t have much flavor. The finish is also very short.",Yes

Mineral and delicious! Distillery switch is a strong move.",Yes

Nose:   Yeasty, with a subtle sulfurous nuance - not at all unpleasant - unique. Orange/lime citrus twists.  Cinnamon, powdered cloves and allspice.  Rich, warm agave tones with hints of tropical fruit and coconut. 
Flavor:   Cinnamon, vanilla bean, salted butterscotch. Followed up with cracked pepper heat, building in intensity on its tail. Velvety viscosity. Fruity rum vibes.  Dark chocolate/coffee on the fade out. 

Priced right.  This will please a variety of palates.  Making #1414 their new home was a great move.",Yes

I’m excited to receive a complimentary bottle of this reboot of the Plata at NOM 1414. Lots of market speak in the advertising online but most of the hyperbole is legit for this product to my taste. Agave on the nose, tons of fruit in the mouth and roast agave on the palate. This has quite the lower lip numb that gives this a punch in your mouth effect that I don’t usually see in a 40% ABV product. Nice finish with a good amount of pepper and ethanol to carry that punchy taste. I’m in love with the result of the blend of yeast for fermentation and the cuts done during distillation. For now this is reasonably priced…seek some.",Yes

1414. Delightful and 

Minerals, mint, raw agave on nose. 

Considerable mouthfeel for a blanco. Luscious and thick.

Minerals, gravel, mint, jalapeño flavors. A bit of white pepper. A little hot at 40 ABV. Lingering finish. Would be outstanding in a ranch water. 

Very solid expression, if not particularly novel.",Yes

The nose is where this tequila misses the mark, the taste is decent but the value proposition is no the best.",Yes

LOTE: CBN 300

Numero 2210/3719

Warming initial nasal impact.
Aroma of green agave, citrus and floral.
Slight warming and soft initial mouthfeel.
Flavor is predominantly green agave, citrus and bubblegum. Some olive brine on the retro nasal.
Very short finish with moderate pepper.
There is an odd aftertaste here for me (inherent of NOM 1438), but probably the best blanco out of the huge 1438 portfolio (however the bar is low from this NOM)",Yes

Lime and citrus on the nose, pleasant and nose packs some punch. Agave and pepper, short finish with some heat. Solid blanco",Yes
Zachary Lynch,55,Unfortunately I believe that my review is based on the fact my bottle was from NOM 1438. Almost no nose but flat alcohol and hardly any flavor to mention. It did mix fine in a margarita.,Yes

Taste Agave,82,NOM 1438. Good balanced blanco. Doesn't have the bright green vegetal minerality profile I like. It's softer overall but still has some minerality towards the end.,Yes

NOM 1414
when first opened, the nose shows minerality, grassy notes, vegetal and brine with lactic notes and yeast. let it sit 30 mins or so and it opens up. the agave comes thru. on the palate - agave, mint, dried fruit, citrus and mild cracked pepper. there's even a hint of chocolate on the finish. 

This is a very enjoyable sipper. I'm pleased with the move to NOM1414.",Yes
David Hoeppner,85,Good mixer !,Yes
Drake Schaneberg,63,"Nose is irregular; vegetal in a medical way. Body is neutral to uneven, agave is present but tamped down by heat and a green, semi-cleaning product tertiary presence. Finish is hot, long, and not overly enjoyable. This is a miss for me, unfortunately.",Yes

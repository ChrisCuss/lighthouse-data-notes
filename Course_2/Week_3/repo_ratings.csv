Adolfo Sosa,69,"Tastes like additives, the blanco did not. It’s not super offensive like other brands but for me it’s not as enjoyable. I can imagine this would be popular with people who like sweet tequila.",Yes
Horton Lee,78,Vanilla strong,Yes
Martino Armstrong,78,Too sweet,Yes
Alan Koller,68,"Supposed to be additive free but man I can't see how. Very sweet. Makes me think I just drank a carnival. Oddly metallic, minerally finish which did not balance well with everything going on. proving complexity doesn't mean quality sometimes.",Yes

Nathaniel Fuller,75,"Aroma is sweet Agave and caramel
Taste is caramel and oak 
Finish is smooth prefer the blanco though",Yes
Kirk Wallace,76,"Very light vanilla and agave aroma. The flavor is sweet light vanilla. The finish is kind of strange, dry and almost vegetable. This bottle was $46 seems a little high.",Yes
John Spinale,63,"this one really missed the mark for me. extremely sweet, almost tastes like French vanilla syrup / creamer. candied fruit, oak extract of some kind. par for the course for 1438. I was told this brand was different than the rest but until I try their high proofs, I'll have to lump them in with the rest of the overmanipulated brands of casa maestri.",Yes

Mike Schultz,65,Marshmallows,Yes
Arianna,62,More intense than a Blanco.,Yes
Michael  DeMaio,81,A bit sweet on the palate. Worth a try if your a beginner or even a tequila drinker. Vanilla and Carmel on the nose and palate. Enjoy.,Yes
Chad Wynter,79,Not bad… a little sweet which I was expecting after drinking their Añejo. Definitely for tequila drinkers who enjoy a sweet finish.,Yes
Cooper Fry,89,Smoky vanilla smell. Super smooth finish,Yes
Stnaley Mayambo,91,"chocolate, vanilla, butterscotch, smooth",Yes
Ken Fields @agave_forward,71,Picking up chocolate and vanilla with a touch of cinnamon. This tastes like it’s loaded with additives. Disappointing.,Yes
David Gleason,68,Not going to waste my time. I found this at “grocery outlet”.  Should be a red flag but I can be a risk taker.  Don’t be on this one.  You work to hard for your money.  There are plenty of hidden gems.  This is not one of them  (You could have picked up Anger Management and had had a decent juice and a great conversation starter with friends. ).,Yes
John Tucker,76,"A bit sweet, more so than your typical Reposado. Prefer it was less than that, one and done, won’t try it again",Yes

Really smooth finish, great mouth feel

Hot chocolate and Xmas style flavour notes, easy drinking with a great finish",Yes

Archie Brown,67,Not impressed….taste of fake caramel and fruit right up front that goes into a vegetable astringent style taste and ends with little pepper.,Yes

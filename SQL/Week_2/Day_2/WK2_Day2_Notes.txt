Combining Data


Quick Comparison (ON VS USING during JOINS)
	•	USING is a shorthand for joining on columns with the same name.
	•	ON is more flexible and allows for complex conditions.
	•	USING eliminates one of the duplicate columns, while ON does not.


Subqueries
	•	SELECT: Used to perform calculations or transformations that are then included as new columns in the main query's result set.
	•	FROM: Used to create derived tables that the main query can join or further query.
	•	WHERE: Used to filter records based on some condition that involves values in another table.


### WHERE:
- Purpose: Filters rows before any groupings or aggregations take place.
- Works On: Individual rows.
- **Aggregation: Cannot be used with aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.
- Example: `SELECT * FROM table WHERE column1 = 'value';`

### HAVING:
- Purpose: Filters rows after groupings and aggregations have been applied.
- Works On: Groups of rows, typically used with `GROUP BY`.
- Aggregation: Can be used with aggregate functions.
- Example: `SELECT column1, COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY column1 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;`

In short, `WHERE` filters before aggregating, and `HAVING` filters after. Both can be used in the same query if needed.
